When you use this method, you will need to specify the particular item that is to be removed. Note that, if there are multiple occurrences of the item specified, then its first occurrence will be removed from the list.  We can consider this method as **“removal by item’s value”**. If the particular item to be removed is not found, then a **ValueError** is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `pop()` --> The pop() method is another commonly used list object method. This method removes an item or an element from the list, and returns it. The difference between this method and the remove() method is that, we should specify the **item** to be removed in the remove() method. But, when using the pop(), we specify the **index** of the item as the argument, and hence, it pops out the item to be returned at the specified index. If the particular item to be removed is not found, then an **IndexError** is raised. \n",
